# ZeeCompiler

Implementation or lexer and parser in Python to make Zee Language made by Zahan Wasif and the implementation is by Ply Python Module. The lexer file tokenize the input of user and parser file parse the output of lexer into the syntax of Zee language.

# Enviorment Variables

You can also add path\to\root\Zee\bin folder in the Enviorment variables and access the Zee language by writing "Zee" in the cmd anywhere.

# Syntax

The syntax of the language is like common programming languages. I wanted to create syntax as simple as possible to help newcomers understand programming languages easily.

    - Assignment operator is '='
    - No declaration needed.
    - loop syntax is "loop ( condition , increment or any operation ) { statement to be executed }"
    - to print a varible we use "print( var( VariableA) )"
    - to print a string or a constant we use only print as "print( 5 )"
    - if statements are also implmented as "if (condition) { Statement } esle { Statement }"
